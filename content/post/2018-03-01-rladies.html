<div id="what-were-about" class="section level2">
<h2>What we’re about</h2>
<p>R-Ladies East Lansing welcomes members of all R proficiency levels, whether you are a new or aspiring R user, or an experienced R programmer interested in mentoring, networking &amp; expert upskilling. Our non-profit, civil society community is designed to develop our members’ R skills &amp; knowledge through social, collaborative learning &amp; sharing. Supporting minority identity access to STEM skills &amp; careers, the Free Software Movement, and contributing to the global R community!</p>
<p>A local chapter of R-Ladies Global, <strong>R-Ladies East Lansing</strong> exists to promote gender diversity in the R community worldwide. We are pro-actively inclusive of queer, trans, and all minority identities, with additional sensitivity to intersectional identities. Our priority is to provide a safe community space for anyone identifying as a minority gender who is interested in and/or working with R. As a founding principle, there is no cost or charge to participate in any of our R-Ladies communities around the world.</p>
<p>We are part of Global R-Ladies group. Here are some links! You can access our presentations, R scripts and more (soon) on our Github account and follow us on twitter to stay up to date about R-Ladies news!</p>

<div id="ps-community-policies-code-of-conduct" class="section level2">
<h2><em>PS</em> Community Policies &amp; Code of Conduct:</h2>
<p>The leadership, mentoring &amp; teaching roles within this Community are held exclusively by minority genders (majority gender speakers may be allowed/invited as one-off guests in exceptional circumstances at the leadership team’s discretion). Due to unexpected demand, we have opened learning participation to all genders, dependent on initial and on-going vetting by the leadership team. However, the stated priority of the R-Ladies communities is the development &amp; support specifically of those identifying as a minority gender, and we, therefore, reserve the right to guard this interest through whatever measures the leadership team deems appropriate. Anyone involved with R-Ladies East Lansing is expected to fully respect each other, the mandate of this community, and the goodwill on which R-Ladies is founded, or face expulsion/a penalty of any form, at the discretion of the leadership team. Full community guidelines are found here: <a href="https://github.com/rladies/starter-kit/wiki" class="uri">https://github.com/rladies/starter-kit/wiki</a></p>
