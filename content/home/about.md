# Biography

I am a computational biologist (@Michigan State University) working on host-pathogen biology, protein sequence-structure-function relationships, and drug repurposing. I am interested in quantitative biology, like to code & develop methods, and enjoy being in a collaborative environment addressing interesting biological questions.

I also like teaching statistical data analysis and visualization, and R/Python programming. I recently founded the [R-Ladies East Lansing chapter](rladies).
